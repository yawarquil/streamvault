      "title": "The Break-Up Rule",
      "description": "Best friends Lizzie and Sam share a drink at their neighborhood dive bar. Sam is nervous: it's her third date with nice guy, Brad. And everyone knows about the the third date -- the sex date. Lizzie scolds her for not having had sex already, which is a violation of the rules passed down to them by their recently married friend, Sienna. Sam acts on Lizzie's advice and seduces Brad, only to have him dump her immediately after their encounter when his girlfriend texts him that she wants him back. Lizzie insists that Sam \"get underneath another man\" right away, and the two friends go prowling at an upscale club. Lizzie focuses on getting someone to buy them top-shelf drinks, while Sam makes the acquaintance of Jason, who turns out to be Lizzie's new co-worker. Lizzie breaks it up, saying that Jason is too clingy and moves on to her own quest -- the sexy, casually dressed guy sitting at the bar, reading a book. Lizzie's initial encounter with this man she dubs \"Dirty Hot Guy\" begins hot and flirty but ends in mutual insults. And when -- adding insult to injury -- her ex, Drew, comes in with another girl, Lizzie is determined not to let it get to her. She and Sam cruise a jiu-jitsu studio, but get little more than hot and sweaty. Afterwards, Lizzie encounters the Dirty Hot Guy in the dive bar and takes him home for sex. Sam learns that her current major crush, Richard, will be at the R Bar; she and Lizzie make a beeline for the place, hoping for a \"chance\" encounter.",

Sam follows Richard on twitter and crashes a fantasy football party to be near him but Richard ends up leaving the party while Sam is in the bathroom. Meanwhile, Lizzie and Jason handle a sexual harassment case for Kyra, who was fired from a cupcake store when she refused sexual advances from her supervisor. Lizzie goes undercover, but can't get supervisor, Jessie, to come on to her, no matter how she flirts. Finally, she corners him in the back room and seduces him. She tells Kyra that she couldn't get the goods on her tormentor, only to learn that Kyra was harassed by Johnnie, the boss's son. Lizzie goes back to the cupcake store to get evidence against Johnnie, leaving Sam at the dive bar with Richard and Morgan. Sam out-drinks Morgan, who passes out; she takes Richard home with her, but he is too drunk to get it up and just falls asleep.",

The girls are talking things over when Cheyenne, Tyler's sub at the bar, volunteers that she once had a magic p**sy -- until she had a baby. Next, the girls try a special steam treatment for their nether regions at a Korean spa, but are horrified when they learn it's a fertility treatment.

Just then, his date arrives -- an older woman who exudes confidence and is not threatened to see him with Lizzie. Later, Lizzie tells Sam that she misses Drew, her ex, and wonders if he's happy with his pretty younger girlfriend.",

Her co-worker, Kate, thinks casual sex is folly and tells Sam so, but when her boyfriend dumps Kate, Sam sees the wisdom of remaining uninvolved.
